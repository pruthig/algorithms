Only multiply equalities when both the sides of inequality is +ve

Square root of x^2 = |x|

(Others were more amorous: I met a femme fatale with a leg in plaster cast. On it was scrawled, like a loverâ€™s note, #Brexit.)

When DS asks for a combination of variables, don't solve for each variable, just extract out the value of equation.
When a value of a variable is sought and you are getting 2 values, then the answer of the problem would be no solution even after combination of the 2 statements

In DS questions for Inequality, it might happen that you have to check -ve and +ve sign of variables of given equation to arrive at a final answer.

x^2 - x means 0 < x < 1

If you find difficult to simplify an expression then simply plug-in values of random numbers and you can check the result with all the answer choices you've got
If the exponent is between 0 and 1 the number > than the original proper fraction

The retailer has less than twice as many radios as clocks in inventory.
r < 2c


Absolute equation both sides, consider only 2 cases  ++ and +-

sq_root(b^2 - 4*a*c) is called the discriminant in the equation. If it is 0, eqn has 1 solution, if > 0 then it gives 2 solution else eqn has no solution
For function problems, pick number and try out  equations

when you do not know the sign of numbers, you cannot take reciprocals
if x < y then 1/x > 1/y either if both are +ve or both are -ve
Do not flip sign when one is +ve and other one is -ve

Taking squares:
if both sides positive raise the square and sign will remain the same
if both side -ve flip the sign. 
If not sure whether number could be +ve or -ve, you cannot do squares
Square of odd is odd and even is even
====================  Fractions/Decimals =================

*   If there is increment of 25% in value for a given commodity over a period of n years, the resultant value will be :
    (original_value)* (1.25)^n
*   Similarly, in case where value if being decremented, say by 20% use the below reverse addition form
    (original_value) * (0.8)^n
*   Use the above method to solve questions like: A commodity price first incremented by 25%, then inc. by 40% and
    finally decremented by 20% 
    The solution will be like : (original_value)*(1.25)*(1.4)*(0.8)
*   Incrementing the value of numerator and denominator by constant amount takes its value closer to 1 and vice versa.

Average speed of a person that walked to/ from for a distance with speeds x and y is 2*x*y/(x+y)

When dealing with tasks, take the task as 1 unit

================ Set ==========================

*   For all evenly spaced set, the average equals - (first+last)/2
*   The sum of that set is (average)*(numer_of_items)
*   If a given median is not integer then there are even number of elements for sure.
*   The product of k elements is always divisible by k!
*   For any consecutive set of odd number of integers, the sum is always divisible by number of elements.
*   Same is not applicable for set of even number of consecutive integers.
*   Weighted average is like giving unequal precedence to the numbers in the set, example:
    
    m*(a/(a+b)) + n*(b/(a+b)) = x
