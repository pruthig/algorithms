Only multiply equalities when both the sides of inequality is +ve

Square root of x^2 = |x|

(Others were more amorous: I met a femme fatale with a leg in plaster cast. On it was scrawled, like a lover’s note, #Brexit.)

When DS asks for a combination of variables, don't solve for each variable, just extract out the value of equation.
When a value of a variable is sought and you are getting 2 values, then the answer of the problem would be no solution even after combination of the 2 statements

In DS questions for Inequality, it might happen that you have to check -ve and +ve sign of variables of given equation to arrive at a final answer.

x^2 - x means 0 < x < 1

If you find difficult to simplify an expression then simply plug-in values of random numbers and you can check the result with all the answer choices you've got
If the exponent is between 0 and 1 the number > than the original proper fraction

The retailer has less than twice as many radios as clocks in inventory.
r < 2c


Absolute equation both sides, consider only 2 cases  ++ and +-

sq_root(b^2 - 4*a*c) is called the discriminant in the equation. If it is 0, eqn has 1 solution, if > 0 then it gives 2 solution else eqn has no solution
For function problems, pick number and try out  equations

when you do not know the sign of numbers, you cannot take reciprocals
if x < y then 1/x > 1/y either if both are +ve or both are -ve
Do not flip sign when one is +ve and other one is -ve

Taking squares:
if both sides positive raise the square and sign will remain the same
if both side -ve flip the sign. 
If not sure whether number could be +ve or -ve, you cannot do squares
Square of odd is odd and even is even

====================  Combinatorics ======================
In problems where it is required to insert things in odd positions use the below depiction

| - | - | - | - | - |
e.g - 4 boys, 3 girls arrange with no girls together - 4! * 5*4*3*2*1

Formula to find rank of a word in dictionary
Write the word and put its relevant alphabetical rank above it(which is relative to the given alphabets)
For example for "RANDOM" it will be - R(6), A(1), N(4), D(2), O(5), M(3)
for each word write the numbers of integers - smaller than that integer on the right - below that number.
For RANDOM it will be : 5, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0
The rank would be 1 + n!*first_number + (n-1)!*second_number + ...
For "RANDOM" - 1 + 5*5! + 0*4! + 2*3! + 0*2! + 1*1! + 0*0! = 1+600+12+1 = 614

Number of lines that can be drawn between set of n points = nC2
Number of triangles that can be drawn between set of n points = nC3

Number of circular arrangements for n things = (n - 1)!
Desc - Fix the position of 1 person and find the max permutation of left out people

====================  Fractions/Decimals =================

*   If there is increment of 25% in value for a given commodity over a period of n years, the resultant value will be :
    (original_value)* (1.25)^n
*   Similarly, in case where value if being decremented, say by 20% use the below reverse addition form
    (original_value) * (0.8)^n
*   Use the above method to solve questions like: A commodity price first incremented by 25%, then inc. by 40% and
    finally decremented by 20% 
    The solution will be like : (original_value)*(1.25)*(1.4)*(0.8)
*   Incrementing the value of numerator and denominator by constant amount takes its value closer to 1 and vice versa.
*   Formula to find average speed - (2*a*b)/(a+b)
*	Rational number can be represented as a/b which can be written as terminating or repeating decimal. The numbers which cannot be represented in this way are called irrational numbers. such as pi, sq(2). There is no overlap between these sets. rational + irrational = real numbers
*	There are 25 primes between 1 and 100
	2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
*	All prime numbers are of the form -> 6*n-1 and 6*n+1
*	If n is a positive integer there is always a prime number p : n < p < 2n
*	If a number equals the sum of its proper divisors, it is said to be a perfect number. 6 = 1 + 2 + 3
*	if a is a factor of b and c, then a is a factor of (b+c)

====================   Word problems ======================

Algebraic translations:
Using equations
Rates and Work
Make RT = D pattern for rate/distance problems.

For average speed calculation and all take distance of 100

Average speed of a person that walked to/ from for a distance with speeds x and y is 2*x*y/(x+y)

When dealing with tasks, take the task as 1 unit

========================= Set =================================

*   For all evenly spaced set, the average equals - (first+last)/2
*   The sum of that set is (average)*(numer_of_items)
*   If a given median is not integer then there are even number of elements for sure.
*   The product of k elements is always divisible by k!
*   For any consecutive set of odd number of integers, the sum is always divisible by number of elements.
*   Same is not applicable for set of even number of consecutive integers.
*   Weighted average is like giving unequal precedence to the numbers in the set, example:
    
    m*(a/(a+b)) + n*(b/(a+b)) = x

======================= Number Properties =======================

if sum of 2 primes is odd then one of the number is definitely will be 2
There are no guaranteed outcome in division operations so it can be odd,even or a decimal number

"OR" means add
"AND"means multiply

n! for arrangement of n things given all are unique and if there are some similar numbers also then the result will be n!/m! where m is the number of like things

GCF of number m and n X LCM of number m and n = m X n
All perfect squares have odd number of factors.
You can perform arithmetic on remainder itself:
*   If a number x leaves 5 as a remainder on division by 7 and y leaves remainder of 5 on divisible by 7. Then the total is : 10, correcting it will give: 10 - 7 = 3

To find total number of factors of a number : like 2,000
divide the number in prime factors - 2^4 + 5^3, now there are 5 options for 2 and 4 options for 3 (considering that a factor might not have any of them) Using combinatorics - (4+1)*(3+1) = 20

If a number is given (variable) and another number is given + the LCM of both the numbers is given, to find the variable put both the number and the LCM in a table and factorize to find.

E <-- to find
45  -  5 X 9
225 -  5 X 5 X 9
Now to complete 225 E must contains two 5's and 0 or more 9's, 
If it contains only 5's it can be 5 X 5 X 5 = 75
or 5 X 5 = 25

============================== Modulus =================================
For question involving finding out the number of solution to a equation which involves multiple Modulus based terms
Get value of x from each sub-equation, put its value and get the outcome and that solution of x should satisfy the initial solution of the sub-equation was inserted.
This method is called the "critical values" method
like: |x+3| – |4-x| = |8+x| How many solutions will this equation have? It will have 0
Here, put values in the extreme and middle range of -3, 4, and -8 one-by-one and find the value of x, it won't satisfy the inserted value.
Range will be :
x<-8
-8<x<-3
-3<x<4
x>4

======================= Coordinate Geometry ==============
*	Perpendicular lines have -ve reciprocal slopes.If slope of line is m, then slope of line perpendicular to this line will be (-1/m)

Short Solutions:

For any prime number n > 3 , whats the remainder if n^2 is divisible by 12.
Consider the product of elements (n-1) and (n+1)
both are before and after the prime number and have a difference of 2. So, (n-1) is divisible by 2 and (n+1) by 4. Since n is divisible by 12 one of the n-1, n+1 will be divisible by 3 because n is a prime number, so the number will be divisible by 24 (2*4*3)
or (n-1)*(n+1) or (n^2 - 1) will be divisible by 24. So dividing n^2 will us the remainder 1.
There are 15 prime numbers between 1-50 and 25 prime numbers between 1-100
Do use P(~A) = 1 - P(A) at appropriate places
