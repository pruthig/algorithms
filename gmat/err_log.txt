Questions on Problem Statements:

1-20
Wrong interpretation of statements              --          Spend more time to extract intricate details
21-40
Missed checking some answer choices             --          Try to cover each scenario
41-60
Wrong calculation                               --          Write more clearly in notebook/scratchpad
Incorrect equation formation from word problem  --          Read statement at least twice
61-80
Wrong assumption                                --          Assume only if certain condition is given with the Qn.

Questions on Data Sufficiency:

1-20
Didn't read the statement correctly		--	    Take time to go through the questions.
21-40	
Forgot A option while solving B			--	    Ponder if combination of both A and B can give results even if o/p seems bleak
81-100
Read statement in rush				--	    Give some more time.
Didn't write down all options.			--	    Most of the questions are trivial, try all options rather than solving the equations.
