To find the number of weighings required for balls:

= ceil|log3(2*num_of_balls)|

Find of 2 rectangles overlap - 
Rectangles won't overlap if one is above the another or is on the left of 2nd one
// If one rectangle is on left side of other
if (l1.x > r2.x || l2.x > r1.x)
	return false;

// If one rectangle is above other
if (l1.y < r2.y || l2.y < r1.y)
	return false;
	
20 coins on table, winning criteria?
Pick 6n + 2 coin number. E.g winning numbers are 2,8,14. First turn pick 2 . opponent can pick max 5 so he picks up to 7. Now u pick one and make it to 8(6n + 2)..up to 14. Opponent can pick max 5 so he leaves at 19.pick last one and win.

Find defective coin:
We are given 5 coins, a group of 4 coins out of which one coin is defective (we don’t know whether it is heavier or lighter), and one coin is genuine. How many weighing are required in worst case to figure out the odd coin whether it is heavier or lighter?
We can best group them as [(G1, 23) and (4)].

You are given two pan fair balance. You have 12 identically looking coins out of which one coin may be lighter or heavier.

Two men will wait between 1 - 2 PM and no one will wait > 15 mins for the other . Find the probability that they will meet
As 15 minutes is quarter of the time between 1 pm and 2 pm, the required probability in this situation is the area of the shaded region - the set of all points satisfying |X-Y|=1/4
There will be shaded area in square  with 2 triangles, each of edge 3/4 units 1-2(1/2*3/4*3/4)=1-9/16=7/16=43.75%





==============  Bits Puzzles ========================

> To multiply a number by 37 -
result = (N<<5) + (N<<2) + N 

> To find missing number in array of size n-1 that contains 1 to n
Do XOR of 1 to n - X1 and do XOR of array - X2
result = X1^X2
