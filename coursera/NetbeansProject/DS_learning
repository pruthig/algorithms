Trees:
Lowest Common Ancestor:
If both nodes are greater than current node, go right, else go left if ! << and >> then stop.

Binary Trees
Any unique tree can be built with any order traversal provided we are given inorder traversal along with the another e.g Pre/Post/Level

For level order traversal in spiral form, we have to use 2 stacks - one for l->r and other for r->l

To find the sum tree - sum(node->left) + sum(node->right) + old_value

If tree is not empty then height = 1 + max of left height and right height
