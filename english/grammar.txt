Conjunctions:
These are the words which separate clauses, the acronym F.A.N.B.O.Y.S can be used to remember it.
Actual conjunctions are : for,and, nor, but, or, yet, so

When the conjunction 'and' is used, make the left and right part of the 'and' parallel i.e. in same form. Either can be of the form 'to be' or it can take the form '-ing'
